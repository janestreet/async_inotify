(** Async-friendly bindings to inotify, see [man 7 inotify].

    Be aware that the interface of inotify makes it easy to write code with race
    conditions or other subtle pitfalls. For instance, stat'ing a file then watching it
    means you have lost any events between the stat and the watch. Or the behavior when
    watching a path whose inode has multiple hardlinks is non-obvious. *)

(** [create path] creates an inotify watching path. Returns

    - the inotify type t itself
    - the list of files currently being watched. By default, recursively watches all
      subdirectories of the given path. See [add_all] for caveats.
    - a pipe of all events coming from t

    When [watch_new_dirs], directories added after [create] will be watched.

    [~events] specifies how to watch [path] and its descendants. When [watch_new_dirs],
    this will always watch for [Created] and [Moved] events, even if not included in
    [events]. Note that the automatic inclusion of [Created] and [Moved] events if
    [watch_new_dirs] is only a property of [create]; subsequent calls to
    [add t]/[add_all t] will not automatically include these, even if [t] was
    created with [watch_new_dirs].

    [wait_to_consolidate_moves] specifies whether to wait a little bit after seeing a
    [Move (Away _)] event for the corresponding [Move (Into, _)] event, so you are more
    likely to get a single [Move (Move _)].
