(* We don't make calls to [Inotify] functions ([add_watch], [rm_watch], [read]) in
   [In_thread.run] because:

   - we don't think they can block for a while
   - Inotify doesn't release the OCaml lock anyway
   - it avoids changes to the set of watches racing with the Inotify.read loop below, by
     preventing adding a watch and seeing an event about it before having filled the
     hashtable (not that we have observed this particular race). *)
